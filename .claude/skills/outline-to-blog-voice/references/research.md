# Research Guidance for Blog Drafts

Use this guide when a blog outline includes claims that need evidence or when the post would benefit from broader perspective. The goal is to surface reliable sources, understand competing views, and ground the draft in reality.

## What to Research

- Definitions and standards (official specs, docs, or primary sources).
- Claims with numbers, trends, or “best practice” language.
- Comparative or controversial statements (“X is better than Y”).
- Historical timelines or origin stories.
- Product or protocol descriptions that can change over time.

## Source Priorities

1. Primary sources: official specifications, docs, standards bodies, original papers.
2. Direct stakeholders: vendor docs, engineering blogs from the maintainers.
3. Independent analyses: reputable industry publications, peer-reviewed articles.
4. Community discussion: treat as anecdotal; useful for framing, not proof.

## Reading for Voice and Perspective

- Find 2–3 distinct voices on the topic (vendor blog, independent engineer, industry analyst).
- Note how they frame the problem, the terms they use, and any disagreements.
- Capture 1–2 short paraphrased takeaways per voice.
- Avoid copy-pasting phrasing; use it to inform tone and framing.

## Evidence Checklist

For each external claim, capture:

- The exact source and date (if relevant).
- A short paraphrase of the claim.
- Why it matters to the outline section.
- Any counterpoints or limitations from another source.

## When to Flag TODOs

- If you can’t find a primary source for a claim.
- If sources disagree and the post doesn’t acknowledge it.
- If the topic is evolving quickly and recent updates might change the claim.

## Output Format (for research notes)

Provide a short research note block per section:

- Section: <outline section title>
- Sources: <2–4 sources with URLs>
- Key takeaways: <2–4 bullets>
- Counterpoints: <optional bullets>
- TODOs: <missing evidence or unresolved questions>

Keep notes concise. The goal is to support the draft, not overwhelm it.
