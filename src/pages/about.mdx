    <p>Hi, I'm George Diab. I'm building this space to collect what I'm learning, prototypes that ship, and ideas that keep resurfacing.</p>
    <p>Over time you'll find posts about product experiments, engineering workflows, and the occasional rabbit hole.</p>
    <p>For now I'm laying the groundwork — wiring up the site, deciding on rhythm, and keeping things simple.</p>
    <p>If you're working on something interesting or just want to say hi, I'd love to hear from you.</p>

I build what excites me and try to open source as much as possible.
