A Facebook experiment evolved into an intensive work period. Following the OpenFloor MVP launch, I plan to gather feedback from early adopters regarding what resonates, what falls short, and future feature requests before continuing development cycles.

I'm grateful for modern developer tools. Getting what we have done in a month would have taken 3-6 months years ago.
