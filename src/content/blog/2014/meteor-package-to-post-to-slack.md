While working at OpenFloor, our team needed real-time notifications sent to specific Slack channels when users performed certain actions. Additionally, we wanted user feedback submissions routed directly to a dedicated feedback channel for team discussion.

Upon searching the Meteor package repository, I discovered no existing Slack package was available. Deciding to contribute back to the community, I created and published my own solution.

**Package:** [slack-notify on Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/package/slack-notify)

I hope the community finds this package as valuable as our team has!
