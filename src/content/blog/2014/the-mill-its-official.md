Max and I have been accepted! We submitted our idea to [The Mill](http://themilldtlv.com/) two weeks ago, and the decision came through today.

## The Origin Story

Everything began as a Facebook experiment designed to boost audience engagement. I published a straightforward status inviting responses and received overwhelming participation and meaningful discussions with connections.

The approach proved successful when repeated days later with identical results. Over the following week, I noticed several friends mimicking this technique on their own profiles—a promising sign of validation.

## From Experiment to Application

Encouraged by my future co-founder, we transformed this simple concept into an application and submitted it to our regional startup accelerator, [The Mill](http://themilldtlv.com/).

## Program Details

The Mill's support package includes:

- Initial $5,000 investment
- Two months of office space at [Work In Progress](http://www.workinprogress.lv/), a downtown co-working facility
- Mentorship relationships
- Networking opportunities

## Looking Forward

The journey begins now. I'm anticipating watching friends and colleagues embrace this interactive approach in the months ahead.
