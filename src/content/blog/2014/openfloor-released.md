Downtown Las Vegas has introduced a new Q&A platform called OpenFloor, developed by Max Aceituno and myself. The platform was [featured in Tech Cocktail](http://tech.co/george-diab-launches-openfloor-2014-08) and combines our expertise in UX design and programming.

## About OpenFloor

The platform functions as "a hyper-engaged question and answer platform that allows anybody the experience of being the authority on a topic." It emphasizes unique UX design to boost engagement for entertainment, education, or brand promotion purposes.

## Similar to Reddit's AMA Format

OpenFloor operates similarly to Reddit's popular Ask Me Anything threads. Several Downtown Vegas entrepreneurs had already opened their floors for questions, including Frank Gruber and Jen Consalvo, whose responses were excellent contributions.

## Current Status

The platform remains in beta—though since Gmail maintained its beta status for two years, OpenFloor can do the same!
